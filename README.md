# Brain-Tumor-Segmentation-Model

This project came out of my work in CS 230 at Stanford University on a team with Nikesh Omprakash Mishra and Scott Lee. In addition, our project was also guided by the help of Stanford Assistant Professor of Medicine Haruka Itakura for general direction on the state of art datasets for skull stripping. The results, architecture, and more elements of the project are highlighted in the repository's report. However, due to Stanford policy, the code cannot be shared publicly. Despite this, the report can be shared to highlight the intricacies of the project.
